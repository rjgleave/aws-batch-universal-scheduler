Sample state machine input templates to describe a job schedule load (before get from dynamoDB)

These are examples of a clean, initial run
{    
  "scheduleId" : "daily-am-load",
  "startDateTime" : " ",
  "scheduleStatus" : " "
}

{    
  "scheduleId" : "daily-pm-load",
  "startDateTime" : " ",
  "scheduleStatus" : " "
}

These are examples of a restart of a failed schedule.  NOTE: you must provide the startDateTime
of the failed job and also set the scheduleStatus to 'RESTART'
{    
  "scheduleId" : "daily-am-load",
  "startDateTime" : "2018-09-24T22:01:52.337998",
  "scheduleStatus" : "RESTART"
}

{    
  "scheduleId" : "daily-am-load",
  "startDateTime" : "2018-09-07T04:29:55.698501",
  "scheduleStatus" : "RESTART"
}
